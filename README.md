## Notes

- Ensure your Hugging Face API key has **Inference API access**.  
- Some models require you to **accept the model license** on Hugging Face before use.  
- For production, consider using a **server proxy** to keep your API key secure instead of exposing it client-side.

## Troubleshooting

**Error:** \`This authentication method does not have sufficient permissions\`  

- Use an API key with the correct **Inference API permissions**.  
- Accept the model license on Hugging Face if required.  
- Check your token scopes in your Hugging Face account settings.
